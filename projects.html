    <h3>Colophon</h3>
    <p>
        This is a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> site. I don’t know whether I’m obliged to say something about being proud,
         but it does the job for now. It’s running a <a href="https://jekyller.github.io/sustain/" target="_blank">sustain</a> theme customized by me. You can blame access problems on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank"> Github pages</a> .
