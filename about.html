	<h1>Contact</h1>							
    <p>Should you find you need to get in touch (it happens, occasionally), you can send an <a href="mailto:{{}}"></a>email to <code>mail</code> at this domain.</p>
    <p>I am <strong>not currently looking for work</strong>, but if you have any interesting ideas, please do get in touch. 
    That said, anything talking about ‘rockstars’ or ‘ninjas’ will be summarily discarded.</p>

        This is a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> site. I don’t know whether I’m obliged to say something about being proud,
         but it does the job for now. It’s running a <a href="https://jekyller.github.io/sustain/" target="_blank">sustain</a> theme customized by me. You can blame access problems on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank"> Github pages</a> .
