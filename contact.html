	<h1>Contact</h1>							
    <p>Should you find you need to get in touch (it happens, occasionally), you can send me an <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">email</a>.</p>
    <p>I am <strong>not currently looking for work</strong>, but if you have any interesting ideas, please do get in touch. 
    That said, anything talking about ‘rockstars’ or ‘ninjas’ will be summarily discarded.</p>	
    
    <p>If you have a project you'd like to collaborate on send me a message.</p>
